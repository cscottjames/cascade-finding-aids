Finding aids display for Cascade CMS. Developed at The Catholic University of America by Christian James, 2019.

The PHP file requires one argument, "file", which is the name of the XML file in the XML directory. This converts the EAD-based XML file into HTML tags.

The HTML file uses AJAX to load the PHP file. It will then apply the CSS style to it. This is meanth to be used inside a web CMS, so I have added the HTML and Head elements for demonstration purposes.
